Notes from dactyl build:
Not the current build, but a good one I think

Printing:
Tree scaffolding
Around 25 hours
My 3D print model was wrong so I had to manually patch a gap
The amoeba boards are smaller so my Universal Toebeans didn't work (had to cut the tabs off of each corner of each key
Heat press didn't quite work for the casing, had to cut off a lip that formed
I think it was cause I used a converter, but the acrylic case didn't work well. Its edges were all slightly off from the actual case.

Soldering:
	Toebeans info:
	All positive goes to vcc
	Also a ug Vcc, not sure what that is

LEDS:
https://www.dlford.io/keyboard-build-guide-per-key-rgb-leds/
Seems like QMK lets us map the LED's to whatever we want so i can do whatever path makes the most sense

Here is how I'm gonna do it
		RHS:
		   20 16 6 3
		23 19 15 5 2
		22 18 14 4 1
		21 17 13
			 12  7
			    11 8
			    10 9

	Pinout for the board:

1	 LED_DATA    Connector   ____
2	 ____                    TRRS[2] GND
3 	 LED_GND                 RST
4    RST                     LED_VCC && TRRS[1] VCC
5    TRRS[3] SDA             ____
6    TRRS[4] SCL             ____
7    ____                    ____
8    COL 1                   ROW 5
9    COL 2                   ROW 4
10   COL 3                   ROW 3
11   COL 4                   ROW 2
12   COL 5                   ROW 1

Notes on changes in QMK:
We will just use the commit history for this...
rules.mk
#define RGB_DI_PIN D3

To sync with the remote:
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

To fix invalid keymap error on qmk flash:
make sure to specify the keymap file!!!!

Had to rotate columns and rows:
"matrix_pins": {
        "rows": ["B5", "B4", "E6", "D7", "C6"],
        "cols": ["B6", "B2", "B3", "B1", "F7"]
    },

problems:
f?r column connection
solder bridge in upper right corner between yellow and black
upper right corner wont stay down

Fixed solder issues:
One solder bridge between R and DIN
One R was plugged into DIN
In both cases a key press on any key on the row would light up the whole column
    I think because the key press shorted DIN (VCC) to the row so that scanning any of the buttons
    on that row would detect a high

NEED TO PLUG INTO DOUT!!!! That was why it never worked!!!
Plugging into the other end of the wire got it all to work

LIGHT Troubles:

Lots of flashing and inconsistency in the lights
	related to some loose gnd and data wires. Very hard to find them because of the setuphhhhhhh
	Blue wire one straight out from the base LED is loose
	Base LED wires are loose
	Various places that I push will kill the LEDs


Have it all working!!!!
Spent awhile flashing the second side and getting keymaps figured out

OLED was easy, just attached it to the bus for I2C. Worked since I already had resistors and everything setuphhhhhhh


Keymap proving hard
Not very much space for RGB animations

LHS
1 2
    3 <--> 4
    6 <--> 5
 
RHS
        2 1
3 <--> 4
5 <--> 6

SEEMS THAT THE THUMBS ARE SWAPPED

Fundamental problem... if the keyboard swaps esc and caps then they aren't swapped on the computer,
prob for any other thing
