Notes from dactyl build:
Not the current build, but a good one I think

Printing:
Tree scaffolding
Around 25 hours
My 3D print model was wrong so I had to manually patch a gap
The amoeba boards are smaller so my Universal Toebeans didn't work (had to cut the tabs off of each corner of each key
Heat press didn't quite work for the casing, had to cut off a lip that formed
I think it was cause I used a converter, but the acrylic case didn't work well. Its edges were all slightly off from the actual case.

Soldering:
	Toebeans info:
	All positive goes to vcc
	Also a ug Vcc, not sure what that is

LEDS:
https://www.dlford.io/keyboard-build-guide-per-key-rgb-leds/
Seems like QMK lets us map the LED's to whatever we want so i can do whatever path makes the most sense

Here is how I'm gonna do it
		RHS:
		   20 16 6 3
		23 19 15 5 2
		22 18 14 4 1
		21 17 13    
			 12  7
			    11 8
			    10 9
		
	Pinout for the board:
	
1	 LED_DATA    Connector   ____
2	 ____                    TRRS[2] GND
3 	 LED_GND                 RST
4    RST                     LED_VCC && TRRS[1] VCC 
5    TRRS[3] SDA             ____
6    TRRS[4] SCL             ____
7    ____                    ____
8    COL 1                   ROW 5
9    COL 2                   ROW 4
10   COL 3                   ROW 3
11   COL 4                   ROW 2
12   COL 5                   ROW 1

Notes on changes in QMK:
We will just use the commit history for this...
rules.mk 
#define RGB_DI_PIN D3

To sync with the remote:
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

To fix invalid keymap error on qmk flash:
make sure to specify the keymap file!!!!

Had to rotate columns and rows:
"matrix_pins": {
        "rows": ["B5", "B4", "E6", "D7", "C6"],
        "cols": ["B6", "B2", "B3", "B1", "F7"]
    },

problems:
f?r column connection
solder bridge in upper right corner between yellow and black
upper right corner wont stay down
